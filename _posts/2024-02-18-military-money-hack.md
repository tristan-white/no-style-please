title: The Biggest Military Money Hack
---
After meeting enough folks in the military that are not taking advantage of the credit card benefits available to them, I decided to write this article to conscisely show how much money can be saved. 

## BLUF
If you're not aware, military members can get fees waived for most major credit cards. This means that you can get the perks of flagship credit cards like the American Express Platinum and the Chase Saphire Reserve without paying the (very expensive) annual card fees.

## The Numbers
Thereâ€™s already plenty of good credit card guides[^1] out there so my goal for this article is to simply and succinctly convey the benefits available to military members so that they might consider making some financial moves that would benefit them immensely.

## A Lesser Known Secret
Most military folks I talk to know about the majority of the credit card hacks that will save them money, but most don't know about this one:

> You can open multiple American Express Platinum cards, for no additional cost, thereby multiplying all the rewards.

Theoretically, there's no limit. Right now I have two platinum cards, but I saw online that someone has ten[^2] and therefore he annually receives:

- $2350 of credit towards airline incidentals
- $1420 of Uber credit
- $800 Saks Fifth Avenue credit
