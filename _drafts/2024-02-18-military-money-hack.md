Whenever I meet someone in the military that doesn’t have any of the “big” credit cards, it blows my mind. 

Please, for your own sake, take a moment to read about the money you could be saving by opening a few credit cards!

There are so many perks that credit card companies offer military members. 


It’s not difficult.
It doesn’t take hard work.

There’s already plenty of credit card guides out there so my goal for this article is to simply and succinctly convey the benefits available to military members so that they might consider making some financial moves that would benefit them immensely.

## just gimme the numbers

Here’s a (very non-exhaustive) list of ways I’ve saved or earned money with my credits cards.
