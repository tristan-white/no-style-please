## FAQs

- How are you? (most frequent question I receive)
	- Not too bad, thanks.
- What's your name? (get this one a lot too)
	- Tristan White
- Say, nice duds.
	- Thanks, but that's not really a question.
- Where are you from?
	- Virginia
- Where did you go to school?
	- University of Virginia
- What do you do?
	- I'm a [Cyber Warfare Engineer](https://youtu.be/k_z_K8a4tuM?si=ixGbbrxtarS3bETN) for the Navy.
- Why'd you join the Navy?
	- Well, I knew I didn't want to pay for college and Uncle Sam said he'd pay for my undergrad if I worked for him for five years. It also seemed like a logical next step in life; both my parents and grandfathers went to the Naval Academy. I was also hoping to travel the world.
- Can I hire you?
	- No. Well, not yet. I'm still in the Navy. Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tr15t4n) and I'll let you know if that changes.
