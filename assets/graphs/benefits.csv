Amex Platinum,Lounge Access,240,"Hard to put a number on how much this is worth. $20 per airport visit is extremely conservative. I'm using this number because that's about how much I would spend on food at the airport if I didn't have lounge access. I go to about 12 lounges/year so $20 * 12 = $240."
